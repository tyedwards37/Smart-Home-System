Project: Smart Home System 
by Tyler Edwards
Added October 2023 

Description: The home system circuit detects the distance from an object and adjusts the color of an RGB LED light accordingly. As the object moves closer or farther away, the color of the LED will adjust. When the object reaches a given distance threshold, the circuit will produce a noise to alert the user. This value will be fixed while the circuit is in use but can be adjusted by the user through a small adjustment to the code. 

Hardware / Software Used:
- Arudino
- Cirkit Designer 
- Breadboard Kit

Reason: For ENGR 101 classs.

Successes: I've worked with breadboards before, but never on this scale so it was nice to see those skills transfer to this project. 

Setbacks: I was not familiar with the Arduino IDE, so I had to learn how it worked while I worked on the project.

Learned: How to work with Arduino, how to use Cirkit, working with a set project timeline
