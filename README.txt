Project: Smart Home System 
by Tyler Edwards
Added October 2023 

Hardware / Software Used:
- Arudino
- Cirkit Designer 
- Breadboard Kit

Reason: For ENGR 101 classs.

Successes: I've worked with breadboards before, but never on this scale so it was nice to see those skills transfer to this project. 

Setbacks: I was not familiar with the Arduino IDE, so I had to learn how it worked while I worked on the project.

Learned: How to work with Arduino, how to use Cirkit, working with a set project timeline
